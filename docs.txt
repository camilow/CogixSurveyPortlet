Optional: add to portal-ext.properties:
com.cogix.SurveyPortlet.ViewsFlashURL=https://my.domain.com:8888/ViewsFlash
default is same domain and protocol as liferay, ie., ViewsFlash deployed as another app in same app server

Using this option makes it possible to run ViewsFlash as a remote application in another server altoegether
( I could use tomcat8514 !!! )

Create ViewsFlash data source
Put optional license key in /etc/cogix/viewsflash.properties

# TBD Security options (single sso, vfadmin  vs  lry.jsp/encryptionkey)

Deploy ViewsFlash.war file directly on app server

ViewsFlash Liferay build:
apiattribute=com.cogix.vwf.api
lry.jsp
In Tomcat8514, using VF8.properties


Security options for no SSO:
apiattribute=com.cogix.vwf.api
lry.jsp
do not protect vfadmin or vfuser in web.xml
appsecurity=user

Security options for SSO:
Protect vfadmin and vfuser in web.xml
Configure SSO somehow between the two apps
appsecurity=user

Be sure to review web.xml carefully, match it to VF8 / 8514.
