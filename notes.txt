Previous liferay7 portlet, before 2020,
used dependencies; this re-do uses resolution:=optional,
which takes Care of thos problems

experimenting with bnd.bnd and build.gradle dependencies:
  com.liferay.portal.kernel;version="[2.0.0,*)",\  NG invalid format.
  com.liferay.portal.kernel;version="latest.release",\  NG must be numeric
  com.liferay.portal.kernel;version="[2.0.0",\ NG invalid format
  com.liferay.portal.kernel;version="default",\ NG
  com.liferay.portal.kernel;version="2.0.0",\ NG, nor 3.0.0 NG, both bad versions

GRAND SOLUTION in bnd.bnd: Import-Package: *; version="0";resolution:=optional

------- older notes from mac mini 2021
So original build process for liferay 7 ViewsFlash.zip was:
In VF6, Rebuild project, ant l7portlet
In CogixSurveyPortlet in arena, rebuild project, cd CogixSurveyPortlet ./gradlew build
In VF6, rebuild project, ant war,  ant liferay7war
puts stuff in release/liferay7

BUG: viewresults adjust urls
-TODO use new viewresults method
-TODO add new way of getting properties from environment as well as portal properties


After deploying jart and viewsflash, use + Widgets / Survey  - Survey

Deleted ViewsFlash app from 7.1 using App Manager, but VF jar still there
I'm leaving it alone

Deploying VF jar 1.0.1 using Aop Manager upload
From liferay7
/Users/camilowilson/liferay7/arena/Cogixsuerpverpoportlet/build/libs

Hmm. ViewsFlash had ended up in Bundle Blacklist, which I set toits
default configuraiton. That removed it from blacklist.properties as well !
https://aspiresoftware.in/blog/blacklisting-osgi-modules-and-components-liferay-7/

BUG Hmmmm. it's looking for 8383
BUG SurveyPortlet.xml is using UCalculate2_.js
AHA Defined in annotations inside SurveyPortlet.java.
Maybe go back to Calculate2.js !!! Can't too dangeous
Ok, so calculate will be wrong ( but wouldnt see it on shared db! )

==>>
- newliferaywar is building a good war, needs to pack it with the portlet as well
- Portlet needs to be rebuilt with correct UCalculate3 in SurveyPortlet #component
and remove obsolete ones
- Redeploying war to see if it makes it through authentication
- Need to rebuild portlet as .0.4 and redeploy in Apps/ Deploy and see
if it replaces previous versino automatically; if not, how do we upgrade
a portlet???
AND IT IS WORKING !!!!!
BTW, can I just use another browser ? No, it's counting on a session
established by lry.jsp !


So next, turn on debugger  (conf already written)
and try to debug lry.jsp and see why it is quitting so quickly.
Or put debugging stmts in it if NG
OK! problem was that vf props had adage and portlet did not. Blank config page.
NOW, problem is that VF is j2ee protected, and it shouldn't be!
Somehow I ended up with wrong war file deployed to arena...
YIKES ! ant build has lost 168 and liferay 6 and vignette !!!
Build is just plain bad - pickus up wrong webxml somehow
and perhaps doesn't pick up other things !



Looks like the blacklisting happened when I uninstalled it !
And when I unblacklisted it, it reinstalled it (1.0.1),
and there it is!
OK, next I build the liferay 7 war in VF.
OOPS has hard coded 1.0.0.jar in ant liferay7 !!! Fixed, now 1.0.1
Sepaate viewsflash.war and viewsflash0-1.0.0.jar are in release directory,
but zip file has wrong jar

Debuggin: standalone.conf
Added -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5555
so...
   JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5555"


WHAT HAPPENS TO SURVEY PORTLET? Is tht the ViewsFlash I see in bnd.bnd?


This isthe deployment log

Portlet Preferences migration:
Liferay 6 in mysql portlet.preferences:
                Survey_WAR_ViewsFlash_INSTANCE_5FeKPrdRzQYo
In Liferay 7,
                com_cogix_SurveyPortlet_INSTANCE_NLkep5dfJTh

Theoretically, can change
update portletpreferences
set portletId=replace (portletId,'Survey_WAR_ViewsFlash_INSTANCE_','com_cogix_SurveyPortlet_INSTANCE_')
where portletId like ('Survey_WAR_ViewsFlash_INSTANCE_%')
So this could be done at portlet initialization time.

BUT the portlet references on pages have also changed... How can I change them too?
Well, table 'layout', column typeSettings like Survey_WAR_ViewsFlash_INSTANCE_  has a corresponding key:

column-1=Survey_WAR_ViewsFlash_INSTANCE_5FeKPrdRzQYo,3
column-2=19,
layout-template-id=2_columns_ii

Could also use Where Is My Portlet app  https://web.liferay.com/it/marketplace/-/mp/application/27156990
column plid is page layout id in layout table... ???

So put the attribute in portal-ext.properties, and it works.
It wil work without the attributes altogeter, as well, and use some default thing.
User Ids are encrypted. Best way would be to use https so nobody can snoop on the key.

---------------------------------- remaining todo's
Final debugging:

 i.e., how does one upgrade?
 BUG:  ViewsFlash Portlet name, and upgradeable portlet name?

So how do I test upgrade?
So the process is:
https://dev.liferay.com/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/upgrading-to-liferay-7#gogo-shell-commands-for-module-upgrades

- install lry7, don't start it;
- run dbupgrade tool in lry7... (that's where I am now); requires mysql 5.7 with utf8

  Try dbupgrade again - failed because interrupted the last time.
  So back to lry 6, without DB, export to my 5.7, shutdown,  make copy of db,
  try upgrade again. It worked  and left lry stopped.
  There is no ViewsFlash on the new server.
  On the new server, need to hook it up to the DB before starting,
  with portal-ext properties! and remove the no0indexing thing

    + Initial virgin deployment; can I do diagnose-1 etc through the portlet,
    with appsecurity=user? I can test with nodb=true -- works!

    + BUG ... default settings are all wrong. Need to put in the war file the
      data files from the portal build !!! done.



    Ok, the portal comes up with the lry6 data in the database, upgraded,
    and the two VF portlet instances say This portlet has been undeployed.
    So next steps:
    - Do these 3 at the outset, before starting
    + add mysql drivers to tomcat  lib
    + add context.xml with vf datasource to tomcat conf
      Stopped lry7 tomcat here so they'll take effect on restart
    + upgrade vf props - need to put in apiattribute=com.cogix.vwf.api and
      com.cogix.surveyportlet.adage=A passphrase

      If deploying VF on a remote server, add URL param to portal-ext.properties !

    - get new war, pointing to vf props, ready ( compare with lry 6 first )
    Restarted lry7 at this point, didn't need to bring it down if do setup first
    - deploy new war
    - deploy new portlet
    - portlets shouldnow work ... !!!


    - Test setup security with pass prhase in vf props and liferay wp-ext.props
    - Test remote deployment by removing VF from local liferay 7,
      adding param to portalext, using a liferay VF that is pointing to that DB

      So, use VF on mac mini, with different context, after deploying latest
      final war to it
      Cotext s/b Liferay 6, which is using local store for liferay anyway
      Interesting ... it is pointing to everis already, just like my liferay 7...
      (But it was using old war!)
      Best to leave that one alone, so that it doesn't disturb VF...
      Ok, so where else can I deploy the VF7 war ( incompatible Default!Default is the problem,
      I think)
      So give me a baby tomcat 8 on macmini
      Here: http://10.1.10.14:8088/ViewsFlash
      Note that because I specify the web app name, it allows multiple web apps side by side !


      <Resource name="ViewsFlash" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
       maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000"
                factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"
       username="cogix" password="cogix123" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
       url="jdbc:mysql://10.1.10.133:3306/everis?useUnicode=true&amp;autoReconnect=true"
      />

      com.cogix.SurveyPortlet.ViewsFlashURL=https://my.domain.com/ViewsFlash

    Created tomcat8 on macmini, port 8088. Everyone's looking at everis !
    So remove Vf from lry 7, add param above to it, deploy VF with that b
    on 8181
          com.cogix.SurveyPortlet.ViewsFlashURL=http://mini.cogix.com:8088/ViewsFlash

http://mini.cogix.com:8088/ViewsFlash/servlet/vfadmin?cmd=dfspot&spotname=Examples

And ready to rest it on localhost 8080 !!! booting now
debug on 63558

Doc for sdk  is in ~/T7 tomcat



asdfasdf




- Deploy lry6 portlet on new, clean lry6, or perhaps in existing one on mini.cogix.com
- Try option 1:
  Upgrade lry to lry 7
  uninstall ViewsFlash app
  deploy VF web app
  deploy ViewsFlash portlet
  See if portlets are pointing to same surveys.
  Let's try that. Configuring portlets as follows:
  Page 2 Practice!portletauth_many_save embedded, show "alreadycompated" message, no view results
  Page 1 Practice!qauth, show take survey and view results

Remember that the liferay war points to a different properties file... should it?
Changed it, now points to vf props


So... llry upgrade is:
unzip lry7, run dbupgrade tool which writes properties and does some upgrade procedures
- possibly deploy new vflry 7 jar file now ?

put new vflry7 war in /webapps
Stop old server?
Start new server and do upgrade procedures?
If I havent deployed VF war or jar, do so now
All s/b ok

Eh gads... Had to install mysql 5.7 ( > 5.5 ) on mac mini. root / cogix123.
Created schema liferay6. Now need toimport the sql file I created before from sql 5.5
into thisnew mysql.  Then I connect liferay 7 via dbupgrade thing, modified,
this this db server. Hopefully upgrade will work this time...







 So upgrade procedure is: after upgrading liferay to liferay 7, remove old VF portlet,
 then deploy new portlet.  Conceivable that I could even just upgrade the portlet !!!
 copy vf prooperties to new default: etc/cogix/ViewsFlashLiferay7.properties
 And add security elements to it
 - encryption phrase
 - remote server url






------------------------- end remaining todos
+ Test: put a different survey in the Others page. take them both at the same time.
+ What about weare you? Yes, it's good.
+ It was including /ViewsFlash/styles !!!!!!!!!

+   Ancient VF6 bug, leaving unfixed:
    But this is worrisome - question numeric 4:
    All characters must be numeric.
    * Two decimal places, comma-separated, range from 5,07 to 6,99
    5,08

    And this: twodecplaces between
    All characters must be numeric.
    * Enter a number between 2.99 and 5.99.
    3,00

    The problem could be validation!!!
    Holy shit... ancient bug. If using Number, with , as decimal point,
    and enter a validation range ( regardless of format ), get All Characters must be numeric.


+ Bug: In expanded mode (take survey) was running examples in expanded mode (perhaps).
  Changed defaults to test/allcs01;
  When I submit that form, it displays examples, but preferences show test/allcs, and results in wrong pollid.

+ Bug: change spot , click on setup, not pointing to valid thing, get not setup message

+ Change underlying survey while it is in progress- ok, it keeps using the pollid
  of the form!


+Need to find comprehensive tests of all styles in VF9 testbed
+ test!allclientside and moreclientside
+ test!all_styles and __fr and __ar

+ Retest 4 options and everything with auth=auto; using all_styles and i18n!

+ french works, not sure - no french text in the form or response

BARF cant create user with default ar!!!

+ picked examples carsartcnaction, and pollid is !satisfaction , missing Exam;ples spotname!
  I picked Examples, then later on chose the pollname...

+ Take survey  wasn't loading up i18nArray, etc.. Fixed by updating Standard so that JS is at the bottom

+  2 calendard windows gives cannot read property styule of null
  in PopupWindow_hidePopup !!! Same fix as above
+ on dupe, don't show continue link

+ Not a but VF9 bug in examples 3 - 1st matrix:  12345 at the top are not centered , because they have a width < the td width!
Which is because definition calls for table width 550, 1st column 200, 5 columsn@50each, total 450, not 550!
When table width is corrected to 450, they all center perfectly.

+ Done  needs testing  TODO: Need to updata portletpreferences and layout tables during init, and test upgrade

+ test Bug  in lry.jsp: if using api, and cmd line includes userid=xxx,
  it's a hack - kill the request.


+ Bug in VF9: view invite list in excel shouldn't include <link>

Perfect with Tom - two surveys, one with i18n, showed them just right,
and nothing available after that!

- The only possible "bug" would be that practice/upload, which has language versions,
shows the English title in the list, when it could show the spanish title;
how would it do that? By adding language=fr to mysurveys api

Tests:
+ i18n - use Practice!upload , ok including viewresults and tallies
+ rotate automatically
+ show eligible
  Need three surveys with ivitaino lists
  Create practice / HR, OPS, MGMT. Need

So practice  upload with peter and tom; i18n; multiple submissions allowed
and practice portletauthonce with joe and tom, no i18n, single submissino allowed

Ok, retest results in i18n. First try in vf
Users: peter is french, lucy is chinese, tom is sspanish, joebloggs is enlgish


i18n test with practice!upload:
Lucy, chinese, took it in english, view results in english, all good.
Why not saving Champions??? It is.... report was old!

+ fixed in vf9, need to port jarover BUG: Taking it as tom in spanish - err msgs and portlet messagges in spanish,
BUt buttons are in English !!!
BECAUSE bug in VF9: when creating copies, texttag, defined in General page,
is COPIED (its defaultvalue seems ok?)
So, when creaing an i18n version __xx, I should NOT copy texttags and should
prepopulate with i18n tags instead !!!
Few people use these, but ... !



VF9 build changes:
+ Standard_.html
+ Add lry.jsp (compare with mac mini); move master to VF9
+ XUStandard2.js simplified setstyleattrbitures
? VF9 Build Standard2_js needs revised setstyleattributes from xustandard2_js from portlet

-VF Bug: if templates.properties calls for x.html ,and that is not present, it doesn't say anything
(and says updating x.html, but update fails)
Happened with Standard_ .html ( extra blank)
+ Standard_.css

Ok, changes to build.xml:
new target surveyportlet
+ Adds lry.jsp
+ uses different web.xml, with etc/cogix/ViewsFlashLiferay7.properties

------------------------

stpoaneme ** is showalleligible
pollname * is rotate automatically, at 457
SurveyConfig status=open
But surveycontent uses status=current
GetLocalized is doing status=open


- Showalleligible is a different jsp! A reasonably simple one, could be done.
It depends on an API that is not in the web services yet, but easy enough to do.
With that, it gets a list of pollids and titles ( from ActiveQuestionnaire objects )
and constructs links; each link seets SURVEYPORTLETTAKING parameter to the pollid.
Looks like we can junk pretty much the old way.
Use the not used api command in getElebigle surveys cmdgetmysurveys&userid=xxx,
which returns pollid?title\t   and it can populate the list.
This parameter needs to be examined in doView and used for the pollid instead of anthing else, if present.
The submission is enough to change TRACKING. The original query selects for surveyprogress of 1 or 2
and when submitted becomes 3 or perhaps is removed altogether. In either case it disappears from tracking.

Launch mysql on caligula:
sudo launchctl load -F /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.oracle.oss.mysql.mysqld.plist


Test Embedded and all other mode combinations of messages
Test Dupe! and 4 options
Test Save!



Poretlet preferences migration - key on what? portletID
System.out.println("ID : " + themeDisplay.getPortletDisplay().getId());

System.out.println("InstanceID: " + themeDisplay.getPortletDisplay().getInstanceId());

System.out.println("Portlet Name: " + themeDisplay.getPortletDisplay().getPortletName());



Perhaps use the Porlet project to build the liferay 7 shippoable  version,
 which is a zip with the VF9 war file unmodified ( after making these changes to its mainline )
 plus the portlet jar file


---------------------------------------------

EH GADS -- unless I change the js properties in build,
the generated JS is cached to  an old version !!!
Same problem with CSS !!!

Save seems to work nicely with Portal auth
YES , for data entry forms,  use portlet auth and allow multiple submissions!

AND this is working:
http://me.cogix.com:8080/o/csp/css/cogix.css

That's because bnd.bnd has
Web-ContextPath:/csp

So, if I'm going to do this, I need:
bnd.bnd path: /ViewsFlash
The ViewsFlash stuff goes into META-INF/resources; I have collisions or duplicates
on /js, need to resolve (if duplicates, hurray!)

To include viewsflash.jar and others, do like I did with cogix.jar.:
libs go in /libs directory;

build.gradle says compile files(libs/cogix.jar);
 in the resulting jar file they are in /lib.   Go figure!

So i would write a  servlet that extends viewsflash, with annotations like Vaadin,
        "osgi.http.whiteboard.servlet.name=ViewsFlash",
        "osgi.http.whiteboard.servlet.pattern=/ViewsFlash/sevlet/viewsflash/*",

And do the same thing with vfadmin

So put js files and css files in different directory in portlet and change build
Write new include that uses include instead !
Test by coying vf.jar by hand first
Init method?!


So a new build for vf9:
copy jar files

In vadding: config.getServletContext ().getContextPath () is /o
In survey portlet: this.getServletContext ().getContextPath () is /o/ViewsFlash !!!

Can't get beyond com.sun.image.codec.jpg... ( perhaps if I edited the MF file?)
OMG - see Import-Package statement in bnd.bnd, removed bad reference and now it loads!
BUT - that removes all other import references... and nothing is visible to the app, eg java.servlet.

See Bundle Headers Reference here
https://www.osgi.org/bundle-headers-reference/

Ok, giving up on this ( there will be more of this later on!)
Although I guess I could patch the MF file after building it and try to deploy it?
Ok, let me try that...

Ok, so it's totally broken right nowm but reverting back to 48 hours ago would put it
back in business with separately deployed war file.

Do the .wabs thing one more time. Create /ViewsFlash/servlet/viewsflash and vfamin servlet
wrappers that tap into viewsflash (two different classes?) would be much better with just one!
which will appear at ....  or perhaps /ViewsFlash/servlet/viewsflash?
Not clear how they will be included... But this does deploy them.
So how do we test this?  The current production liferay build is liferay deploy ready.
It needs to add the new servlet, which can be removed from the

BTW I remember reading that the wab tool requires version 3 of web xml?
Try that first?
The build for liferay7 is related to this project ( independent war file for VF )

----

+   Going back to VF war file deployment. Note that in bnd.bnd, 1st two lines could be ViewsFlash,
    perhaps that would ease with migration...
    Bundle-SymbolicName: ViewsFlash
    Bundle-Name: ViewsFlash
    Done.

+ Use new encryption in ne Belize

+ with renamed portlet, what about the preferences keys for the table?
  Well, by setting the name in both portlet and config action, I may have succeeded -
  it is using the same name !!!









---------   BAD STUFF, obsolete, ****  Liferay  -------

Trying to put servelt stuff into vf6's war   WATCH OUT!
Creates viewsflash.xml ... so I would need toremove it from web.xml ?!
Ok, now are tinkering with viewsflash.jaava and Portaal/web.xml !!!

I could do servlet/vfadmin as a new servlet which includes viewsflashservletviewsflash!
Ok, tried removing it from web.xml; succeeded at deploying /o/ViewsFlash,
but the servletURL insisted on a 404. There's probably a way to do it
using Felix:
http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-http-service.html

Ok, giving up.   Restore viewsflash.java .
Liferay war didn't change, thanks to osgiweb.xml

Its likely that if the servlet was just called /servlet/viewsflash, with no app name,
it might work (if i declare url accordingly, or declare webapp as o
Probable conflict between ViewsFlash app and ViewsFlash/servlet/viewsflash
Well, it kind of did; but then /o/ViewsFlash/css/cogix.css killed it internally,
who know why.  Couldn't retrieve css any more and servlet died with 404.
Ok, it's a bug inside liferay.   Too much. STOP.
